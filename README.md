# Ubercart: Who Bought What

This module collects and displays relevant information about purchases,
including purchaser name, quantity, payment status, and all attributes.

Finally, the result may be downloaded as a CSV so you can do whatever you
want with it. Please note that, if you want, you can directly go to the product
page by setting pid = to the product node id. You can get a CSV by adding
`csv=1` to the url.
